## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over time. It enables collaboration, prevents data loss, and allows you to revert to previous versions of your work.

## Difference Between Git and GitHub

- **Git**: A version control system that tracks changes in your codebase locally.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for hosting Git repositories, enabling collaboration and code sharing.

## GitHub Alternatives

1. GitLab
2. Bitbucket
3. SourceForge

## Git Fetch vs Git Pull

- **Git Fetch**: Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
- **Git Pull**: Downloads changes and merges them into your current branch in one step.

## Git Rebase

Rebasing is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving the base of the branch. It rewrites commit history to create a linear sequence of commits.

Command:

```bash
git rebase <branch-name>
```
